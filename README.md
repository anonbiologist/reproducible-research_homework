# QUESTION 4

1) Random Walk

The random walk function generates a random walk trajectory.

It starts at the coordinates (0, 0), and generates a random angle for each step of fixed size (0.25 units), for a given number of steps. Each point of the random walk is coloured according to the time step, to produce a traceable colour gradient.

![random_walk](https://github.com/anonbiologist/reproducible-research_homework/assets/153086380/5ccb1566-61c7-4563-a741-9d0ed6dbeb60)

The two plots show two separate random walks, each with 500 steps.

As the angle of movement for each time step is random, the overall pattern produced is also random and erratic. For both plots, there appears to be some regions that are more densely clustered whilst others are more dispersed. 

For the two graphs shown above, although their movement is erratic, they do both appear to exhibit an overall trend from start to finish. The first plot is tending towards (-x, -y) coordinates, and the second plot is tending towards (+x, -y) coordinates. It is certain that these 'trends' have formed due to chance alone.

As well as this, if many plots of the random walk were generated, although individual plots would vary highly in final position, the average final position across all plots would tend towards the starting point.

2) Random seeds

A random seed is a number that is used to initialise a pseudorandom number generator (PSNG). A PSNG is an algorithm that generates a sequence of numbers that approximate and therefore resemble a true sequence of random numbers. 

The sequence of numbers generated by a PSNG is not truly random, as the sequence itself is determined by the initial value inputted into the PSNG. If it were to be random, the output would differ regardless of the initial input. Despite not being truly random, the sequence of numbers share the same statistical properties of a true sequence of random numbers, and therefore can be used for applications that require randomness.

Therefore, a random seed is a number provided to a PSNG. By choosing the same seed, you can make simultaneously generate a sequence of random numbers that is reproducible across applications.

## Instructions

The homework for this Computer skills practical is divided into 5 questions for a total of 100 points (plus an optional bonus question worth 10 extra points). First, fork this repo and make sure your fork is made **Public** for marking. Answers should be added to the # INSERT ANSWERS HERE # section above in the **README.md** file of your forked repository.

Questions 1, 2 and 3 should be answered in the **README.md** file of the `logistic_growth` repo that you forked during the practical. To answer those questions here, simply include a link to your logistic_growth repo.

**Submission**: Please submit a single **PDF** file with your candidate number (and no other identifying information), and a link to your fork of the `reproducible-research_homework` repo with the completed answers. All answers should be on the `main` branch.

## Assignment questions 

1) (**10 points**) Annotate the **README.md** file in your `logistic_growth` repo with more detailed information about the analysis. Add a section on the results and include the estimates for $N_0$, $r$ and $K$ (mention which *.csv file you used).
   
2) (**10 points**) Use your estimates of $N_0$ and $r$ to calculate the population size at $t$ = 4980 min, assuming that the population grows exponentially. How does it compare to the population size predicted under logistic growth? 

3) (**20 points**) Add an R script to your repository that makes a graph comparing the exponential and logistic growth curves (using the same parameter estimates you found). Upload this graph to your repo and include it in the **README.md** file so it can be viewed in the repo homepage.
   
4) (**30 points**) Sometimes we are interested in modelling a process that involves randomness. A good example is Brownian motion. We will explore how to simulate a random process in a way that it is reproducible:

   - A script for simulating a random_walk is provided in the `question-4-code` folder of this repo. Execute the code to produce the paths of two random walks. What do you observe? (10 points)
   - Investigate the term **random seeds**. What is a random seed and how does it work? (5 points)
   - Edit the script to make a reproducible simulation of Brownian motion. Commit the file and push it to your forked `reproducible-research_homework` repo. (10 points)
   - Go to your commit history and click on the latest commit. Show the edit you made to the code in the comparison view (add this image to the **README.md** of the fork). (5 points)

5) (**30 points**) In 2014, Cui, Schlub and Holmes published an article in the *Journal of Virology* (doi: https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00362-14) showing that the size of viral particles, more specifically their volume, could be predicted from their genome size (length). They found that this relationship can be modelled using an allometric equation of the form **$`V = \beta L^{\alpha}`$**, where $`V`$ is the virion volume in nm<sup>3</sup> and $`L`$ is the genome length in nucleotides.

   - Import the data for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses taken from the Supplementary Materials of the original paper into Posit Cloud (the csv file is in the `question-5-data` folder). How many rows and columns does the table have? (3 points)
   - What transformation can you use to fit a linear model to the data? Apply the transformation. (3 points)
   - Find the exponent ($\alpha$) and scaling factor ($\beta$) of the allometric law for dsDNA viruses and write the p-values from the model you obtained, are they statistically significant? Compare the values you found to those shown in **Table 2** of the paper, did you find the same values? (10 points)
   - Write the code to reproduce the figure shown below. (10 points)

  </p>

  - What is the estimated volume of a 300 kb dsDNA virus? (4 points)

**Bonus** (**10 points**) Explain the difference between reproducibility and replicability in scientific research. How can git and GitHub be used to enhance the reproducibility and replicability of your work? what limitations do they have? (e.g. check the platform [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/)).
